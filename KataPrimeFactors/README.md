# PrimeFactors

Write a function that generates factors for a given number.

### Input: 
One argument – a positive, non-zero integer

### Output: 
A list of the integer’s prime factors in numerical sequence


### Things to know
If the integer has no prime factors, return an empty list.

The data types of the argument and return value depend on the programming
language you are using.


### Examples
f(1)  ==>  []

f(4) -> [2, 2]

f(6) -> [2, 3]

f(8) -> [2, 2, 2]

f(9) -> [3, 3]

f(12) ==>  [2, 2, 3]

f(27) -> [3, 3, 3]
